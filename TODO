To do for Sombrero:

	- Change the layout system so that we can display two nodes without having to show everything in between them. A good way to start on this is to add the ability to delete nodes, while readjusting their containing layouts and handling their child layouts nicely - started
	- Have layouts draw lines between the things they connect, possibly with arrows
	- Integrate the trace generation part with the trace viewing part
