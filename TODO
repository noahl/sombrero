To do for Sombrero:

	- Change the layout system so that we can display two nodes without having to show everything in between them. A good way to start on this is to add the ability to delete nodes, while readjusting their containing layouts and handling their child layouts nicely - started
	- Integrate the trace generation part with the trace viewing part
	- There's a new Python library called ctypes that might be better than SWIG. Check it out.
		- Update: the version in Python 2.5 is pretty hackish, but it might get better. And SWIG is pretty hackish too. This is worth looking at more.
