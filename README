About Sombrero
--------------

Sombrero is a utility designed to let you see how your programs actually work. Sombrero is based on Hat, a set of programs which does something similar for Haskell (hence the name - Sombrero is a type of Hat). However, Sombrero only works with Python programs right now.

Sombrero works by interpreting a given Python program in its own special Python interpreter. This interpreter runs the Python program just like the usual interpreter would, but while it runs, it creates a trace which records all of the actions it had to take to run the program. Sombrero then provides a viewer which lets you look at this file and see what, exactly, your program did.
