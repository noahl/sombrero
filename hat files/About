About This Folder
-----------------

The folder 'hat files' contains all of the files and folders I created while
trying to make sombrero read and write hat-2.04-format trace files. (This is
hat, the debugger for Haskell, currently available at hat.haskell.org.)

This was the first thing I tried with sombrero, so the files also reflect my
confused state of mind as to how this should actually work.

If you want to see how Hat works, definitely also check out hat.haskell.org.
The most useful thing is probably the internal memos there, which describe how
Hat works on the inside. I wish I'd looked at them sooner.



The things that were used by sombrero:

art.h, ntohl.h - general header files needed by the Hat C code.
hat-tools/
	   hat-check - a program from the Hat project that checks a Hat trace
	   	       file to see if it has the correct format. Modified by me
		       to be 64-bit compatible.
sombrero - the old 'sombrero' shell script. this sets the PYTHONPATH correctly
	   for the old directories.
tracer/
	hat-c.c, hat-c.h - modified versions of code from the hat project, which
		 	   allows a program to write hat-format trace files
	hat-c.i - an interface file for hat-c.{c,h}, used with SWIG to generate
		  Python wrappers for them. (This was the module 'Trace').
trace-reading/ - this folder has code that I used to read hat trace files. this
	         was before I realized that reading and writing are two sides of
		 the same coin, and should probably be handled together.
	       program.py - contains the Python reading interface.

The extra things:

experimentation/ - Hat files I traced while I was trying to figure out the Hat
		   trace file format.
trace-generation-testing/ - this has some files I used to make experimental
			    trace files so I could see how hat traces worked.


The .gitignore file in the main project also contains entries that are very
useful when working with the Hat files.
