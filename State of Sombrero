There are the issues that should be taken care of.

Short-term
----------

- Trace the rest of Python. This is not too bad - just go through the types of
  AST node and add code for each one.
- Get the multiple-file-handling code working again. It broke during the
  transition to the Recorder interface. Fix it.

Medium-term
-----------

- Refactor the tracer so AST nodes are objects that know how to trace
  themselves. Then maybe simplify the eval_tracing and exec_stmt functions in
  trace_interpret.py to wrap them and adjust the parent stack?
- Reconsider how variable references are represented. Maybe make a new type of
  node in memory_recorder.py that shows the name of the variable that was
  referenced in the display, so it's easier to understand.

Long-term
---------

- The interface currently assumes that the trace is a tree. Redo it so it can
  handle more general graphs, then use this ability to make the trace cooler.
  (Note: integrate this with the special tracing of variable references to make
  the trace a general DAG.) (Also: search Google for "graph drawing contest" to
  get algorithms.)
- Give the user the choice of what intermediate values to record. This would
  require the user interface to include either the AST or the program in a form
  that could be connected to the AST.
