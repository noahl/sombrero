A Sombrero trace recorder is a way to record traces for later use. A recorder
most provide the following interfaces.

Recording interface:

	Recorder.makeLiteral(parent, val)
	Recorder.makeFunction(parent, name, argnames)
	Recorder.makeComputation(parent, func, args)
	Recorder.enterComputation(obj)
	Recorder.finishComputation(obj, result)
	
	Recorder.top_level (the root parent)

Reading interface:

	Literals and Computations should provide a Program object interface,
	  with all that entails.
	Functions and Literals should provide a name() method (a "Data"
	  interface?)
